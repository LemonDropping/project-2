# Game Finder

## Description
As video game lovers, we were driven to build a website that allows users to search their favorite games and review them. The video game search engine is a review website that allows a user to find a game, review it and comment on the game. The application also allows the user to sign up and login into the website so that they can have an account with the application giving them the ability to access the website and use it to its full potential. 

## features
- Search: Anyone using the website will be able to search their favorite video games. Results are returned based on the search.

- Game Details: Users can click on a game from the search results to view detailed information about the game, including its release date, rating, and a brief description.

- MVC Architecture: Game Search uses the Model-View-Controller MVC to separate concerns and make the code more maintainable.

## Running The Application
1. clone the repository by using the git cloning command
2. Run npm install 
3. Run npm start after the npm install
4. The web application will no be running on http://localhost:3000/


## How To Use

I will be going back to this assignment in the future so I can better understand it and not work with people who don't want to put in the work.
