## Description
As video game lovers, we were driven to build a website that allows users to search their favorite games and review them. The video game search engine is a review website that allows a user to find a game, review it and comment on the game. The application also allows the user to sign up and login into the website so that they can have an account with the application giving them the ability to access the website and use it to its full potential. 

## How To Use
1. Sign up by clicking on the login tab in the top right.
2. Search your video game you would like.
3. Once you have found your game you can click on it and begin rating it and writing your review. 
4. After you write your review you can submit it with everyone elses.
5. You can also comment on peoples existing reviews and leave comments.
